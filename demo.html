Due to excellent infrastructure and good scope for the game in cities, many small town boys would not succeed defeating them in the Ranji Trophy. But this man proved it all wrong. MSD had seen a dream, which many feared to see.Hailing from a very small town of Ranchi,
                              Dhoni dared to dream and with courage and guts make that dream a reality. He started his career as a Ticket Collector in Indian Railways.

                        <br>
                        <h4>Start of  M S Dhoni Age</h4>
                        <p class="p-2"> The particular series proved to be the luckiest one for the cricket legend he scored remarkable 148 runs in only 123 bowls in Visakhapatnam and surpassed the previous record of the highest score by an Indian wicket-keeper.<br>

                            In 2005, Sri Lanka’s bilateral series of ODI captain cool made a mark again by hitting 183 runs off 145 deliveries that too without getting knocked out! In the same tournament, Dhoni earned the Man of the Series title and finished the series with the highest run aggregate of 346. The year 2006 was considered productive for the former Indian skipper as he performed
                             excellently in a series against Pakistan and grabbed a spot in the ICC ODI Batsmen Rankings by replacing Ricky Ponting.</p>


                        <br>
                        <h4>World Cup Experience of MSD</h4>
                        <p class="p-2">The period preceding the 2007 Cricket World Cup went well for the Indian cricket players as the squad won series against Sri Lanka and West Indies.

                            <br><br>
                            The span wasn’t that great for Dhoni’s as his under-construction home in Ranchi was vandalized by political activists. However, he performed amazingly in a match against Bangladesh when the team India was on a tour to their home soil in 2007. Dhoni was held the Man of The Match as well as the Series.
                            <br><br>
                            Mr. Cool vice-captained the Indian cricket ODI squad for the series against South Africa and England. In June 2007, BCCI upgraded Dhoni to an ‘A’ grade contract and named the skipper for the India T20 squad in the same year in September.

                            <br><br>
                            Unfortunately, the MS dhoni game wasn’t at the peak in the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup.
